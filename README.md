We plotted the number of shared 24-mers between the subread and its reverse complementary subread.
The real data have a long tail.
But the simulated data don't.

Why?

## dot plot with itself

We extracted the subreads having many number of shared k-mer (24-mer)
and made dotplots with itself using [gepard](http://cube.univie.ac.at/gepard).
